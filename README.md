## Purpose
This repo was built for the RIT -> NTID -> ICS -> SVP group of 2021. It aims to provide a *taste* of programming a console, desktop, and mobile app within a 3 hour time frame. It is worth mentoning that some programming practices might look rather odd, but know these are in place to simplify the landscape therefore being more intuitive to a new student.
